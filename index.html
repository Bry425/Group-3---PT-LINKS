<h2>Introduction</h2>
<xmp>In HTML, the <a> tag (also called the anchor tag) is used for creating link in html. It allows you to link
websites, other pages in your project, specific sections of the same page, email address, phone number, and even files for
download.
Understanding how it works is essential because links can open a lot of ways to be much more creative in your web page.</xmp>

</section>


<section>
<h2>How To Properly Use</h2>
To put a link somewhere in your webpage, you would first need to know how to properly use the anchor tag.
The basic form of an anchor tag is:<br>
<xmp><a href="URL OR FILE LOCATION">Clickable text that the reader will see</a></xmp>
You can also link to <mark>external websites, other pages within your project, specific sections of the same page, email address,
or phone number.</mark>

</section>


<section>
<h2>Types of URLs</h2>
There is two types of URL that you can use in the anchor tag, <mark>Absolute</mark> and <mark>Relative</mark> URL.

<h4>What is a Absolute URL</h4>
An <mark>"Absolute</mark> URL" is a full web address that points directly to a specific location on the internet, <mark>including the protocol</mark>(The http:// or https://),
the domain name, and optionally the path to a file or page.<br><br>

<b>Example:</b>
<xmp><a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a></xmp>

<h4>What is a Relative URL</h4>
An <mark>Relative</mark> URL" is a file location that is within your own project folder rather than specifying the full web address, thats why its called a "Relative URL",
because its on the same project folder.<br><br>

<b>Example:</b>
<xmp><a href="about.html">About</a></xmp>

</section>


<section>
<h2>Target Attribute</h2>
By <b>default</b>, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.<br><br>

<b>The target atrribute specifies where to open the linked document or page</b><br><br>

The target attribute can have one of the following values:<br><br>

_self - <b>The Default</b>. Opens the page or document in the same window/tab as it was clicked<br>
_blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab<br>
_parent - Opens the document in the parent frame<br>
_top - Opens the document in the full body of the window<br><br>

Example:
<xmp><a href="https:www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a></xmp>

</section>

<h2>Other Uses of Links<h2>
<h4>Using an Image</h4>
<xmp>To use an image as a link, just put the <img> tag inside the <a> tag:

<a href="https://example.com">
<img src="example.jpg" alt="Description"></a></xmp>

<h4>Link to an Email</h4>
<xmp>Use "mailto:" inside the href attribute to create a link that opens designated email.

Example:
<a href="mailto:example@gmail.com">Email</a></xmp>

<h4>Using a Button as a Link</h4>
<xmp>JavaScript allows you to specify what happens at certain events, so we can use it to change what happens after clicking a button.

Example:
<button onclick="document.location='default.asp'">Example</button></xmp>

<h4>Linking to a specific part of a page</h4>
<xmp>
The link:
<a href="#section2">Section 2</a>

The Specific Part:
<h2 id=section2">Section 2</h2>

or you can do it like this:
The link:
<a href="#contact">Jump to Contact section</a>

The specific part:
<section id="contact">
<h2>Contact Us</h2>
<p>Email: example@gmail.com</p>
</section>
</xmp>
